This repo hosts the scripts required to reproduce the plots in the paper, [FLARES XII: The consequences of star-dust geometry on galaxies in the EoR](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230304177V). The analysis scripts can be found inside `scripts`. Many of the scripts require the particle data from the simulations, so if required shoot us a query on the FLARES [website](https://flaresimulations.github.io/).
